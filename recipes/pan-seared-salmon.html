    <h3 class="headings"> Description </h3>
        <p class="text">Golden and crisp on top and just barely cooked at the center, this pan seared salmon is one of my go-to recipes when I have to hit the kitchen running. Not only is it fast—15 minutes start to finish!—it’s also elegant. In fact, it’s the way salmon is typically prepared in fine dining restaurants (the same method is often used for cooking steak and scallops). This is really more of a technique than a traditional recipe, and it’s simple to master at home.</p>
        <p class="text">The secret to making perfect pan seared salmon is in the combination of selecting the right size salmon fillets, proper seasoning, and resisting the urge to fiddle with the fillets as they cook. Letting the salmon sear untouched in hot oil creates a beautiful, golden crust that makes the dish restaurant-worthy.</p>
    <h3 class="headings">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 slices lemon</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="headings">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Preheat a large heavy skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat salmon fillets with olive oil; place skin-side down in the preheated skillet and increase heat to high. Sprinkle with capers, salt, and pepper; cook for 3 minutes on one side. Turn salmon fillets over; continue to cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer salmon to individual plates and garnish with lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
