    <h3 class="headings">Description</h3>
    <p class="text">A lot of the magic in a vegan kitchen happens in the pantry, and this Lentil Bolognese is a prime example. It’s a comforting, tasty meal made exclusively with budget-friendly, shelf-stable ingredients. In fact, many of my favorite pastas are made with pantry ingredients but they never sacrifice on flavor (think vegan caramelized onion pasta, Italian white bean and pasta stew, or creamy pantry pasta).</p>
    <p class="text">I used to enjoy a good bolognese (a lot), but after going vegan, the plant-based bolognese recipes I tried fell flat (or terribly). They mostly tasted like vegetables in marinara sauce.</p>
    <h3 class="headings">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
